#Powershell Rules
- Do NOT combine any commands other than pip installs.
- Send each command independently without using &&.
#Follow Best Practices
- Use virtual environments.
- Use a .env.
- I already created a .env with a Google Gemini API Key for you to use.
#Styling
- Use Tailwind for styling to make our project look professional.
- Use the Tailwind CDN. Do not compile it locally.

#Prompt
- Make a single page python flask webapp that has a chat interface.
- We'll connect the chat interface to Google Gemini's latest model.
